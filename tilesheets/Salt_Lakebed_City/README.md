# SLC Background Layers

## Sizes and Scrolling

The character and the "layer" they are on, the parallax = 1. A non-scrolling background, e.g. stars = 0. These include my guesses as to what these background layers' parallax values might be. Can tweak from there IMHO.

### Stars & Moon

Size: 400x240 (full screen)

Static background (no parallax scrolling horizontally or vertically).

### Mountains

Size: 600x39

Parallax = 0.1

### Back buildings

Size: 206x35

Parallax = 0.25

Notes: To loop endlessly

### Front buildings

Size: 586x69

Parallax = 0.5

Notes: The tops of these buildings should overlap the back buildings at default position.
