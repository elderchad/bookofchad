Background is 7 screens in height (1680px).

The camera starts at the top, and the logo fades in for a few (2?) seconds and fades out right in the center of the screen.

The camera then scrolls down from the top slowly until it hits 480px from the bottom (2 screen heights) where it will stop, and the Earth and Moon will be near the bottom of the screen in that position.

As the screen scrolls, account.png fades in for ~2 sec and then fades out again.

Wait ~1 sec

The logo fades in for a few (2-3?) seconds and fades out right in the center of the screen (logo.png frame order: 0, 1, 2, 3 (hold for a few seconds here), 2, 1, 0, destroy).

Wait ~1 sec

The title.png fades in for a few sec, and then everything but "The Book of Chad" fades out. (title.png frame order: 0, 1, 2).

Wait ~.5 sec?

title.png fades in "Another Testament of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints" (title.png frame order: 3, 4, 5).

The camera hits 480px above the bottom of the background.png, where the Earth and Moon are in view below the title.

The Earth and Moon scroll down out of camera view

I'm imaging the text below will fade in/out while the camera is slowly scrolling from the top of the background img down to the second to last screen, where the earth img and moon img come into view.

Everything but "The Book of Chad" in title.png fades out (frame order: 4, 3, 2, where 2 stays for the remainder of the intro).

** TEXT

1. (fade in) A Cabin Crunch Bros Translation (logo img) (fade out)

2. (fade in) An account written by

THE HAND OF CHAD

Upon plates

taken from the plates of Nephi (account img) (fade out)

3. (fade in) THE

BOOK OF CHAD

ANOTHER TESTAMENT OF

THE CHURCH OF

JESUS CHRIST

OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS (title img)

(all but THE BOOK OF CHAD fades out, the earth and moon imgs scroll down out of vision and disappear.

The screen starts scrolling down once more to the bottom on Earth, including moon_red img in the sky, and showing Chad smoking on top of the temple.

Start & options display, and the selector is used start or options.)

This will probably take some effort getting all the timing right, and depending on how the song lines up we may want to tweak. Hopefully this is enough to get started for now.
