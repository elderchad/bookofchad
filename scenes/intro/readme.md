Background is 7 screens in height (1680px = 240 x 7).

I'm imaging the text below will fade in/out while the camera is slowly scrolling from the top of the background img down to the second to last screen, where the earth img and moon img come into view.

Song: YouKilledOurLordIntro.mp3

** TEXT

1. (fade in) A Cabin Crunch Bros Translation (logo img) (fade out)

2. (fade in) An account written by

THE HAND OF CHAD

Upon plates

taken from the plates of Nephi (account img) (fade out)

3. (fade in) THE

BOOK OF CHAD

ANOTHER TESTAMENT OF

THE CHURCH OF

JESUS CHRIST

OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS (title img)

(all but THE BOOK OF CHAD fades out, the earth and moon imgs scroll down out of vision and disappear.

The screen starts scrolling down once more to the bottom on Earth, including moon_red img in the sky, and showing Chad smoking on top of the temple.

Start & options display, and the selector is used start or options.)

This will probably take some effort getting all the timing right, and depending on how the song lines up we may want to tweak. Hopefully this is enough to get started for now.
