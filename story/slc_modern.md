# NPC (in city)

### Smitties

- My family and I are heading to Adam-ondi-Ahman just as soon as we can reunite with our resurrected ancestors! We’re even camping at the cemetery so we can try to beat the traffic.

- I can’t believe the prophet and an apostle were murdered in Israel! I mean, I guess I can, since it was a specific prophecy of the Second Coming, but still, leaving their dead bodies on the street to rot for days? That’s just disgusting…

- Sure glad I stocked up my food storage recently.

- I guess we can stop praying for moisture now?

- He's coming, and He's seen what I've done!

- I fetching love ice cream after an uplifting Priesthood Session. I'm just going to take my time and enjoy this before heading home.

- Those filthy taffy-pulling lazy learner bigot keep calling us "Smitties". I've chosen thus far to not be offended, but one more time and I'm pulling out my musket.

- Actually, it's good the world is in such horrible chaos. Now our big brother can come back and fix it all for us, since we're so pathetic and incapable of fixing these issues on our own.

- I'm so excited to make love to my wife's 18 year old body again. Woops, did I say that out loud?

- ### Apostates

- I'm off to give my boyfriend a Priesthood Blessing with consecrated whiskey. Oh, aren't we so mischievous?!

- You can leave the church, but the church won't leave you alone. They've installed cameras and speakers across the whole city, playing hymns fused with HeartSell soundwaves to force you to feel the spirit.
-
- The Strengthening Church Membership Committee is surveilling every Smitty and apostate for any dissent. They're currently in a full media fast, since "the world" apparently wants to destroy them.

- The Lord's name is Heroin, and I took it in vein.

# Encounter with Cain

Cain
Fuck yeah, you're back. I saw the moon forgot its tampon, so I figured I'd see ya soon.

Chad
Behold, Cain, for how long hath I been gone?

Cain
170 years? 200? Fuck if I know, I didn't count. Shit's changed though, man. Some shit's just fucked, some shit's just weird. Blacks are more accepted and my business is fuckin' boomin'. How'd ya fulfill the moon prophecy?

Chad
Verily, verily, I say unto you, it doth be a long story, yea, even goddam exceedingly long.

Cain
Well time's runnin' short bro, so let's do this shit. Smitties here are freakin' the fuck out - storin' food away, repentin', movin' back to Missouri. Shit's goin' down.

Chad
Yea, and it appears as though thou hath been enjoying yourself.

Cain
Hell yeah, bro, you like my new wheels? Check out the sound system and shit.

Chad
...

Cain
Yo why you gotta look at me like that? I run a prosperin' as fuck business.
