*NPC (in city)*

- My family and I are heading to Adam-ondi-Ahman just as soon as we can reunite with our resurrected ancestors! We’re even camping at the cemetery so we can try to beat the traffic.

- I can’t believe the prophet and an apostle were murdered in Israel! I mean, I guess I can, since it was a specific prophecy of the Second Coming, but still, leaving their dead bodies on the street to rot for days? That’s just disgusting…
