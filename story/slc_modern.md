# NPC (in city)

- My family and I are heading to Adam-ondi-Ahman just as soon as we can reunite with our resurrected ancestors! We’re even camping at the cemetery so we can try to beat the traffic.

- I can’t believe the prophet and an apostle were murdered in Israel! I mean, I guess I can, since it was a specific prophecy of the Second Coming, but still, leaving their dead bodies on the street to rot for days? That’s just disgusting…

# Encounter with Cain

Cain
Fuck yeah, you're back. I saw the moon forgot its tampon, so I figured I'd see ya soon.

Chad
Behold, Cain, for how long hath I been gone?

Cain
170 years? 200? Fuck if I know, I didn't count. Shit's changed though, man. Some shit's just fucked, some shit's just weird. Blacks are more accepted and my business is fuckin' boomin'. How'd ya fulfill the moon prophecy?

Chad
Verily, verily, I say unto you, it doth be a long story, yea, even goddam exceedingly long.

Cain
Well time's runnin' short bro, so let's do this shit. Smitties here are freakin' the fuck out - storin' food away, repentin', movin' back to Missouri. Shit's goin' down.

Chad
Yea, and it appears as though thou hath been enjoying yourself.

Cain
Hell yeah, bro, you like my new wheels? Check out the sound system and shit.

Chad
...

Cain
Yo why you gotta look at me like that? I run a prosperin' as fuck business.
