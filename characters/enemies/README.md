OIL VIAL FIRE

To be played after the oil vial contacts the ground

5 frames, to played 1>2>3>4>3>2>1>5

Would be cool to spawn two on either side of the first, then 2 more on the outside again.

BOOK OF MORMON THROW

BOM to be spawned and the last frame of the throw animation

8 frames to be played in order, looping back to 1

Would be cool to spawn it right above the ground level, travelling similarly to the boomerang in Castlevania, and at the end, go up one tile and then come back towards the thrower. E.g. jump over first approach, then you can slide under it on its return.
