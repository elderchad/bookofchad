### Dialogue

_Note: This is very Mega Man-esque._

_The hand in the veil extends outwards towards the player when approached. When the player interacts with the hand in the veil (via the up arrow to indicate interaction, the following dialogue occurs._

Hand: What is that?

Chad: The Second Token of the Melchizedek Priesthood, the patriarchal grip, or Sure Sign of the Nail.

Hand: Has it a name?

Chad: It has.

Hand: Will you give it to me?

Chad: I will, upon the five points of fellowship, through the veil. "Health in the navel, marrow in the bones, strength in the loins and in the sinews, power in the Priesthood be upon me, and upon my posterity through all generations of time, and throughout all eternity."

Hand: That is correct.

(Three distinct mallet taps are heard.)

Hand: Let him enter.

(The veil raises up to open the boss room behind.)

TODO: Custom handshake token dialogue art

_When the player enters the room, the boss warp-in animation plays on the opposite side of the room, coming in from above down to the ground. Immediately once it completes, the Jesus warp-in animation plays. Finally, it then transitions to his idle animation while his health bar is created and filled up._
