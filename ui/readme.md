# Items and their descriptions (WIP)

### Sword of Laban

This exceedingly fine sword made of precious steel provides a moderate level of damage.

Nephi stole this sword from the drunk and unconscious Laban, and beheaded him with it. "It is better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief."

1 Nephi 4:13

### Sunstone

Beautifully carved stone adorning the Nauvoo temple provides a powerful ground impact.

This stone was featured prominently on the Nauvoo temple, symbolizing the dawning of the restoration of the gospel in these, the latter days.

### Pepperbox

Classic 19th century small pepperbox pistol with long range, but requires ammo.

Smuggled to Joseph while incarcerated in the Carthage Jail, who fired at the approaching mob, killing two men and injuring another.

### Pocketwatch

This beautifully crafted pocketwatch can latch on to certain terrain.

Owned by John Taylor, and worn during the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, who was saved by a musket ball that was stopped by this item in his breast pocket.

### Temple Ceremonial Robes

This clothing, modelled after those described in the Bible, allows the wearer access into the House of the Lord.

Robe, girdle (sash), hat, and green fig-leaf apron worn only within the House of the Lord to do their super cool rituals in.

### Temple Garments

These garments of the Holy Priesthood provide protection against fire and lava.

Underwear marked by Masonic symbols worn constantly by Smitties as a reminder of the covenants they made in the temple, and which offers protection from harm.

### Breastplate

Wearing this provides increased defense, and the ability to translate unknown languages through the power of the Urim and Thummim fastened upon it.

Deposited by Moroni alongside the Golden Plates, Liahona and the Sword of Laban, this was unearthed by young Joseph while he was in the throes of treasure-digging.

### Golden Plates

Inscribe within the sealed portion of these solid gold plates to save your progress.

Weighing roughly 200 pounds, this ancient American record testifying of Jesus' visit to the USA, was partially translated into the Book of Mormon.

### Liahona

This round brass ball of "curious workmanship" reveals the map of the area you are currently in.

Being among the other items unearthed by Joseph Smith, this "compass" was used by Lehi and co. to travel through the wilderness and across the ocean to USA.

### Seer Stone

This chocolate colored rock reveals the location of treasure in your proximity.

Joseph Smith put this stone inside his hat and looked within to translate the plates from afar. The same manner in which he would try, and fail, to find buried treasure.

### Tithing Slip

Grants you the ability to obtain your Patriarchal Blessing.

This receipt is obtained to keep a record of your tithe payments. You wouldn't want to miss out on becoming a fucking god!

#### Patriarchal Blessing

An ordinance administered by the laying on of hands and inspired by the Holy Ghost, containing the recipient's lineage in relation to the twelve tribles of Israel, along with personal guidance, counsel and promise.

### Temple Recommend

Super cool club card to get into the exclusive house of dad.

Every full-tithe-paying non-gay-practicing Smitty who doesn't jerk off is given this card which is used to get in the Temple so you can perform those really cool, awe-inspiring, not creepy at all rituals.

### Missionary Name Tag

Every Smitty serving a mission is given one of these to be worn while proselytizing. On it is written "Elder", followed by the owner's last name. Chad got to go on a mission, and he hasn't even grow a foot or two.

### Coffee

Increase your energy with this delicious and aromatic brew from the finest arabica beans, picked by the world's finest slave laborers.

### Cigarette

Look cool as fuck in flavor country while you inhale this delicious concoction of tobacco, tar, ammonia, methane and other high-end chemicals to increase your energy.

### Beer

Chug this stout like a fucking man and increase your energy. Get picking up some hot tail for a steamy night, but make sure to use a fake name in case your huge fertile dick knocks her up.

### Weed

Hotbox this bomb ass dank ass crystalized perpskerp with your bros and start trippin' blaze and talkin' about how fuckin' deep Tool is, bro.

(Others I'll work on later, and we can update these ones as needed. Just first draft to get placeholder text going.)
