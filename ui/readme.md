# Items and their descriptions (WIP)

### Sword of Laban

This exceedingly fine sword made of precious steel provides a moderate level of damage.

Nephi stole this sword from the drunk and unconscious Laban, and beheaded him with it. "It is better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief."

1 Nephi 4:13

### Sunstone

Beautifully carved stone adorning the Nauvoo temple provides a powerful ground impact.

This stone was featured prominently on the Nauvoo temple, symbolizing the dawning of the restoration of the gospel in these, the latter days.

### Pepperbox

Classic 19th century small pepperbox pistol with long range, but requires ammo.

Smuggled to Joseph while incarcerated in the Carthage Jail, who fired at the approaching mob, killing two men and injuring another.

### Pocketwatch

This beautifully crafted pocketwatch can latch on to certain terrain.

Owned by John Taylor, and worn during the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, who was saved by a musket ball that was stopped by this item in his breast pocket.

### Temple Ceremonial Robes

This clothing, modelled after those described in the Bible, allows the wearer access into the House of the Lord.

Robe, girdle (sash), hat, and green fig-leaf apron worn only within the House of the Lord to do their super cool rituals in.

### Temple Garments

These garments of the Holy Priesthood provide protection against fire and lava.

Underwear marked by Masonic symbols worn constantly by Smitties as a reminder of the covenants they made in the temple, and which offers protection from harm.

### Breastplate

Wearing this provides increased defense, and the ability to translate unknown languages through the power of the Urim and Thummim fastened upon it.

Deposited by Moroni alongside the Golden Plates, Liahona and the Sword of Laban, this was unearthed by young Joseph while he was in the throes of treasure-digging.

### Golden Plates

Inscribe within the sealed portion of these solid gold plates to save your progress.

Weighing roughly 200 pounds, this ancient American record testifying of Jesus' visit to the USA, was partially translated into the Book of Mormon.

### Liahona

Being among the other items unearthed by Joseph Smith, this "compass" was used by Lehi and co. to travel through the wilderness and across the ocean to USA.

### Seer Stone

This chocolate colored rock reveals the location of treasure in your proximity.

Joseph Smith put this stone inside his hat and looked within to translate the plates from afar. The same manner in which he would try, and fail, to find buried treasure.
